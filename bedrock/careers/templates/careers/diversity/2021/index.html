      <h2><span class="highlight green">Introduction</span></h2>
      <p><strong>As an organization with employees, volunteers, and community members spanning the globe, we strive to ensure that who we are, what we build, and how we choose to engage the world around us reflect our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion — and that all feel empowered to join our movement.</strong></p>
      <p>Our annual disclosure gives us an opportunity to both reflect on our ambition to be a more diverse and inclusive organization and to hold ourselves accountable to the commitments we've made. In 2021, we leveraged the momentum from 2020 to build a more representative workforce and an inclusive culture internally and externally. We did this by uplifting voices that have been historically marginalized and by building a better internet that works for everyone. </p>
      <p>Leaning into our own culture of technical experimentation we piloted programs, captured feedback, and refined and scaled efforts, all in hopes of increasing our impact. With a spirit of curiosity and an openness to innovation, we ran over 100 experimental programs and initiatives of varying scale, complexity, and size. Our experiments included launching a 6-month program aimed at <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/careers/mozilla-inclusion-champions/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">building skills for allyship</a>, partnering with podcasts to <a href="https://getpocket.com/collections/behind-the-worlds-first-viral-video" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">amplify historic events</a>, expanding partnerships with HBCUs to explore ethical computing and apply an <a href="https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/blog/using-education-and-intersectionality-to-fight-bias/">intersectional lens to bias in AI</a>, and increasing investment in a venture capital fund supporting women and minority-led businesses. Each effort enabled us to learn more about how best to serve the needs of our organization and our communities. These actions enabled over 65% of our organization to meaningfully engage with DEI efforts and make progress in their own learning journey. </p>
      <p><strong>So what did we learn from our experiments?</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Mozillians care and are willing to invest their work and personal time to fostering a more inclusive work environment</li>
        <li>We are all on the journey of awareness and though we may be in different stages of our journey we recognize the ongoing commitment from each of us is imperative</li>
        <li>The more people we have further along the journey, the more chances we have to consistently identify opportunities to improve who we are, how we work, and how we show up in the world</li>
        <li>More than ever before we have the necessary tools and capabilities to accelerate our work in this space than we did in the past</li>
        <li>Curating unique opportunities for learning and engagement helps people participate in ways that are authentic to them</li>
      </ul>

          Increased the representation of historically excluded communities:
          <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
            <li>At the Mozilla Corporation we increased the representation of Black/African Americans in the US from 4.8% to 7.8% and increased representation of women from 33.5% to 37.0%.</li>
            <li>At the Mozilla Foundation, we increased representation of Black/African Americans in the US from 5.7% to 8.3% and we increased representation of Hispanic/Latinx in the US from 5.7% to 8.3%.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li class="bold-item">
          Expanded outreach and advocacy:
          <ul class="mzp-u-list-styled">
            <li>Garnered 18,000 hours of donated voice recordings in over 100 languages for Mozilla Common Voice, an initiative to help diversify voice data sets.</li>
            <li>Hosted our first-time-zone agnostic MozFest, going “live” over 20 hours a day. We welcomed over 9,500 participants from 143 countries around the world, increasing global majority participation by over 2000%.</li>
            <li>Engaged three Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and over 20 students in curriculum exploring ethical computing practices.</li>
            <li>Partnered with an HBCU and HBCU consortium to launch a speaker series at MozFest and develop projects as part of our global Trustworthy AI Working Group.</li>
            <li>Hosted 15 Dialogues & Debates panels where 75% of speakers were women and over 50% were people of color. These leaders discussed biased algorithms; how AI in our daily lives reinforces historical power imbalances across gender, race, and class; and how to build better data stewardship models that return value to communities.</li>
            <li>Awarded $260,000 in funding through the Creative Media Awards for Black artists who use art to spotlight how AI can reinforce — or disrupt — systems of oppression.</li>
            <li>Increased our curated content in Pocket with 10 new collections celebrating heritage, historic moments, and social justice movements resulting in 217,000 views.</li>

      <h3><span class="highlight black">Looking Forward in 2022</span></h3>
      <p>In 2021, we continued to build upon our three-pillar strategy
        <strong>(who we are, what we build, and what we do beyond products)</strong> and approached our efforts with a spirit of innovation, experimentation, and impact. We were inspired by the universal commitment of Mozillians to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace and world.
      </p>
      <p>Our commitment to diversity and inclusion does not stop with our Racial Justice Commitments nor our progress over the past few years. In 2022, we will enhance our focus in the following areas: </p>

      <p>In the five years of reporting representation metrics, we have seen a 13 percentage point increase in women at Mozilla Corporation and a 10 percentage point increase in women at Mozilla Foundation. Mozilla Corporation also saw a 6 percentage point increase in Black/African American representation.</p>

        <p>Women continued to make up a little over two-thirds of the Mozilla Foundation employee base.

Individuals with other gender identities now make up nearly 8% of leadership roles. Men represent roughly 44% of hires and roughly 57% of departures.

Black/African-Americans in technical roles increased from 3.1% to 5.8% and in leadership roles increased from 9.3% to 9.6%. We did not see the same level of growth in the Hispanic/Latinx employee base. Hispanic/Latinx Mozillians accounted for 4.3% of the US employee base and 4.1% in technical roles which was 4.1% and 3.7% in 2020 respectively. Hispanic/Latinx members of the leadership group rose from 1.9% in 2020 to 3.8% in 2021. While we had good representation in our hiring rate, we saw that we were not able to retain Hispanic/Latinx employees to the extent we would have liked. Similarly for Asian Mozillians, we saw a year-over-year decrease in representation from 16.5% in 2020 to 16% in 2021. Leadership representation dropped from 18.5% to 15.4%. Both of these were mostly driven by the 20% attrition rate.</p>

          <li>In order to be in compliance with global laws, we do not track race and ethnicity outside of the United States ast this time. All race and ethnicity data are for employees in the United States only, and categories are driven by United States government requirements for disclosure.</li>
          <li>Leadership representation excludes executive-ranked technical fellows and only includes all levels of directors, vice presidents, and the executive team.</li>

      <p>In June 2020, spurred by the racist events occurring in the United States and in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, we set <a href="https://blog.mozilla.org/en/mozilla/first-steps-toward-lasting-change/" target="_blank" rel="external noopener">our racial justice commitments</a>. These commitments were a first step toward lasting change and were meant to be measured at the end of 2021.

We set aggressive targets to ignite momentum and encourage innovation. While we did not meet all of our goals, we were encouraged by the universal commitment of Mozillians to engage, learn, and take action within their sphere of influence and beyond. The framework offered by our racial justice commitments — <strong>“who we are, what we build, and what we do beyond products”</strong> — continues to guide our work. </p>
