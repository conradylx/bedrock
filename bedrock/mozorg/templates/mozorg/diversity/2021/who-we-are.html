          <p class="mzp-c-card-feature-desc">Since 2013, Mozilla has participated in the Outreachy program, which aims to increase participation from underrepresented groups in free and open-source software. All Outreachy participants work remotely with their Mozilla mentors, allowing for a geographically diverse group of interns. Round 23 was hosted from May through August 2021, and we recently welcomed Round 24 participants for the December 2021 through March 2022 cohort, with interns hailing from Australia, Germany, Nigeria, and Pakistan. </p>
